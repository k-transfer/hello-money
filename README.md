# Hello, Welcome to K-Transfer
This is a repository for a P2P-Money Transfer application using express, node, mongodb, dotenv, bcrypt and others. What makes it different is it is ALL End-2-End-Encrypted, which means it logs transactions for only 24 hours, then the whole system deletes them. The app is only downloadable from an active user who generates QR-codes that need to be scanned in order to have the app available and ready to use.
